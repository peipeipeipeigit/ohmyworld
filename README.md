it's a crazy world which needs some life solutions.

well, they said i need to write down something about me, so here am i.
i'm now staying at my parents home, being a sinderalla, doing almost every kind of things that a secreatary will do for my mom.
i hope this half year would be my last year to stay here and either of lost my freedom.
that's all.
why?
